# 🍊🍊🍊 Getting Started with DailyCitrus🍊🍊🍊

Waking up on Saturday mornings and watching cartoons was one of my favorite pastimes as a kid. The toons are great but paired with a fresh cold glass of orange juice equals an unmatched combo.

Daily Citrus is inspired by those mornings where my imagination flowed freely as I entered new worlds from the toons I religiously watched every weekend.

This Demo highlights how to render your own cartoon/2d world of your own! Learn what it takes to create your own interactive experience with Matter.js + React!

To show the benefits of Matter.js this demo is a game created to challenge the player and encourage developers to think outside the box.

The game is simple. Get the **Big Orange** to the green platform!

click and drag your mouse across the screen to produce Mini oranges. The mini oranges help you push the big One!

### `Technologies used`

React.js & Matter.js

Matter.js matched with react allowed for me to render 2d worlds with my own custom physics.
